Writing Documentation
*********************

The documentation is located in the docs folder.

The format is restructuredText and the documentation generator is `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_

Some useful material to get started

* `Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx CheatSheet <http://openalea.gforge.inria.fr/doc/openalea/doc/_build/html/source/sphinx/rest_syntax.html#>`_
* `reStructuredText Primer <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html>`_


insatll the rtd theme
pip install sphinx_rtd_theme

The documentation can be generated by going to the doc folder and run ``make html``. This will
generate html docs with the same theme as readthedocs.org. To open it up locally simple open up the
file ``doc/_build/html/index.html``

Documentation that has been commited will show up in readthedocs.org.
