  Drop the math directory into cpc/lib

  executable xml. drop this one into cpc/plugins/executables
  
- the python script double.py is a script that the worker will run. To make this one accesible 
  to the worker you will have to either specify the absolute path in executable.xml. Just change
  double.py to MY_ABSOLUTE_PATH/double.py. You can also add the absolute path to your PATH by calling
  export PATH:$PATH:MYABSOLUTE_PATH
